Issue Summary:
Duration: November 12, 2023, 09:00 - 12:30 (UTC)
Impact: The outage affected our emoji service, resulting in a 50% increase in user frustration and a 20% decline in overall engagement. Users experienced a lack of expressive options, impacting chat functionalities and user interactions.
Root Cause: An unintended misconfiguration in the emoji service API led to a cascading failure, rendering the majority of emojis inaccessible.

Timeline
09:00: Issue detected through a flood of user complaints about missing emojis in the chat interface.
09:15: Initial investigation focused on frontend components, assuming a display issue. Users were temporarily offered an "Emoji Lite" experience.
09:30: Monitoring alerts triggered for increased error rates in the emoji service API.
10:00: Misleading investigation into database performance, suspecting slow emoji retrieval times. Database resources scaled up, but no improvement was observed.
10:30: The incident escalated to the DevOps and Backend teams for a deeper dive into the emoji service infrastructure.
11:00: Identification of the misconfiguration in the emoji service API, causing a breakdown in emoji retrieval and rendering.
11:30: Configuration settings corrected, and a script deployed to regenerate missing emojis.
12:30: Full restoration of emoji functionality, with monitoring confirming normalized error rates.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: An accidental misconfiguration in the emoji service API settings led to an inability to fetch and render emojis.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was rectified by adjusting API settings, and missing emojis were regenerated and cached for a seamless user experience.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
  - Strengthen monitoring for critical API endpoints to promptly identify anomalies.
  - Implement stricter access controls on configuration changes to prevent accidental misconfigurations.

Tasks:
  Monitoring Enhancement:
    - Set up additional alerts for specific emoji service API error patterns.
    - Integrate anomaly detection to identify deviations from normal emoji retrieval patterns.

  Access Controls:
    - Restrict access to emoji service configuration settings, requiring multi-factor authentication for changes.

  Documentation:
    - Enhance documentation for the emoji service, detailing configuration parameters and best practices.
    - Conduct internal training sessions on the importance of cautious configuration changes.
